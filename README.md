A plugin for the simulation of the 3D Point Spread Function of an optical systen, particularly a microscope objective.
 
Calculates the PSF as the squared Fourier Transform of the pupil and uses the angular spectrum to propagate the PSF in 3D.  
The following aberrations are included:
- phase aberration described by a Zernike polynomials with n-m coefficients
- aberration induced by a slab, with a refractive index different from the one at the object (only scalar approximation is used, polarization not considered yet).  

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html

## Installation

You can install `napari-psf-simulator` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-psf-simulator


To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator.git


## Usage

1) Lauch the plugin and select the parameters of the microscope: `NA` (numerical aperture), `wavelenght`, `n` (refractive index at the object),
   `Nxy` (number of pixels), `Nz` (number of slices), `dxy` (pixel size, transverse sampling), `dz` (voxel depth, axial sampling)

2) Select an aberration type (if needed) and press `Calculate PSF` to run the simulator. This will create a new image layer with the 3D PSF.
 
   The option `Show Airy disk` creates 3 ellipses as a shapes layer, showing the boundaries of the diffraction limited blob.

3) Click on the `Plot PSF Profile in Console` checkbox to see the x and z profiles of the PSF.
   They will show up in  the viewer console when `Calculate PSF` is executed.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request. 
The plugin has been concived to be modular allowing the insertion of new aberations and pupils. 
Any suggestions or contributions on this are welcome.
